LOGCATCH(1)                 General Commands Manual                LOGCATCH(1)

NAME
     logcatch – run a process with private /dev/log

SYNOPSIS
     logcatch [-s] [-t fd | -u path] [command ...]

DESCRIPTION
     logcatch spawns command in a mount namespace with a private /dev/log,
     thus its syslog(3) messages are not sent to the global syslog instance.

     The options are as follows:

     -s        Strip the syslog prefix from the message lines (with -t).

     -t fd     Print syslog messages to the file descriptor fd.

     -u path   Map /dev/log to the Unix domain socket found at path.

EXIT STATUS
     logcatch fails with a non-zero status code or successfully executes into
     command.

CAVEATS
     logcatch requires special permissions to run, either root or the Linux
     CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  The capability is dropped upon starting
     command.

     logcatch only works on Linux kernels with mount namespaces enabled, see
     mount_namespaces(7).

     When using -t, a helper process is spawned that exits when command
     terminates; for any of its child processes that remain, logging stops
     working.  If this can happen intentionally, you should consider using -u
     instead and use a tool like socklog(8) to do the logging.
